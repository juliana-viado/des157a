            <h1>Final Design Project Brief</h1>
            </header>

            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>I am redesigning the Game On! Project by creating better graphics and creating changing the background from night to day based on score level.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>The current project incorporates a static image of a penguin in different moves instead of animation through a gif format. My goals are to improve the current game by adding more visual and audio elements and rules.</p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>A cohesive look and feel that ties in with the winter-themed event can incorporate visual strategies like motion graphics or animated penguins to add movement and energy to the design. Using Gestalt principles, similarity in shapes, colors, or patterns can create a cohesive look that ties everything together, making it easy to understand. To create an engaging penguin dance-off, a bright and lively color palette of pink and blue can create a visually striking effect. The typography should be clear and easy to read, with bold letters to emphasize the game name. Categorizing dance moves like footwork, spins, jumps, or gestures, and assigning point values to help score the penguin players.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>For time-based behaviors, I can create a countdown clock that displays how much time is left in the dance-off and have a penalty system in place for penguins who go over the allotted time for their dance. The visual feedback could include +1  or X2 points for each dance move. Animations can include a changing background play during the dance that responds to the quality of the penguin's moves, such as fireworks or flashing lights. Aural feedback could include a music track that plays during the dance, as well as sound effects that play when certain dance moves are performed successfully.</p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal of a penguin dance-off is to create a fun and engaging experience for the users, where they can enjoy watching penguins dance and score points based on their moves in the spirit of competition. To achieve this, the first step is to ensure the design is visually appealing, using cohesive visual elements and staying true to the winter theme. Secondly, categorizing the dance moves and assigning point values creates a scoring system that is full of anticipation and motivates players to keep watching and engaging with the game. </p>
