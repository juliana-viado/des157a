            <h2>Update Restart Button</h2>
            <p>It is better to have a distinct button to restart the game instead of the logo. It was difficult to find unless there was a guided tour of how to navigate it.</p>

            <h2>Redefine Rules</h2>
            <p>Normal Dance Dance revolution shows a space where you have to press an arrow at a certain point. It was unclear that mine just had a line limit and the rules are different due to experience constraints.</p>

            <h2>Arrow Indicator</h2>
            <p>An indicator to show if they pressed the arrow on the screen is nice to know in case they are unsure if the button worked or not.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>From my user test results, I plan to add a button for the music, restart with a precaution warning, and rules. The rules an illustration, so it is easier to understand and make a clear differentiation between Dance Dance Revolution. I am not sure if I will add the arrow indicator yet, but I will if time permits.</p>
