            <p>Amir Dori's article, "<a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a>" offers valuable insight from 250+ projects in the game industry's strategies to improve monetization and retention. I was surprised about dark UI and how it is strategically used to force user actions towards personal gain with store buttons, more apps, and ads. I was familiar with UI positioning but sometimes overlooked its importance when designing so it was a friendly reminder. It was interesting that Dori stated that most ad-serving platforms require at least a 10-pixel margin from the ad to the interactive content in order. I am a bit confused about what "touch end" and "touch begin" means.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>On October 30, I went on a scavenger hunt with a friend, Jannie, around Downtown Davis. The goal was to collect 7 stamps from the participating restaurants: Three Ladies Cafe, YiTea, Uniboil, Hoho Market, Cajun Feast, Yolo Berry, and Honey D Cafe. The event lasted three days and there was no purchase required. Muncho hosted the Halloween promotion event to promote their app and local businesses associated with them. YiTea was the last restaurant, so we bought two boba drinks. We dropped off the stamp card there to enter to win an iPad mini. This image is one of five images that shows the food or drinks of the places we visited. The collection shows us supporting local businesses, socializing downtown, and engagement in promotions to win a prize. Despite not winning, I had a fun day with Jannie and learned about new restaurants around downtown Davis.</p>

        <p>The theme of this picture is Korean skincare, featuring products from Glowiest, COSRX, Klairs, Good Days For All, and Papa Recipe. The products include a jade roller, sheet masks, and a moisturizer. It is splayed out on a striped, knit blanket, which appears to be an international haul of Korean skincare that was shipped to her house and threw on her bed's blanket upon unpackaging her purchase. The most interesting aspects of this picture is the blanket and brightness of the picture because it could have been taken outside. The most obvious part is that it is all Korean skincare, and the most mysterious part is the location of the shot.</p>

            <p>Michael Gonchar's article, "<a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>" emphasizes the importance of practicing visual thinking skills regularly, paying attention to the details, asking open-ended questions, building on other's observations in order to understand the world, introduce new ideas, and build community around conversation. By implementing these practices, product designers can improve user experience by adding elements that may not "belong" to spark curiosity and interaction to dig deeper. </p>

            <p>Before reading this article, I took a look at the pictures for context. I am already subconciously trained to find meaning behind the mediums I absorb. I was confused by the collection of the images at first until I read the text. I would identify myself as a detail oriented, critical analyzer. It is interesting how the article was written in 2015, which is around the same time I learned about "Talking to the Text" or as I knew it in middle school as "annotating". I think it is important as a designer to be understanding to why people think or feel a certain way which can be stimulated with photos. I wish I learned something new because this article was repetitive for me. I think there is more of a shift towards more videos or animations of static images in actively engaging users.</p>

            <p><a href="http://cylndr.co.kr/?ckattempt=1">Cylndar</a> is a an example of creative use of animations with a healthy balance of static images. I enjoyed the clock aspect of using a static image and moving hands on top of it.</p>

            <p>Naema Baskanderi's article, "<a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>" advocates for a better use of modal windows that avoids showing error, success, and warning information. By implementing these practices, product designers can improve the user flow. </p>

            <p>User intitated actions, urgent messages, and popups for less important content is the way to go! Modals, overlays, and dialog windows should be used to grab attention, input user information, enlargement, and notifcations. The cancel button should be simple to find to return to main page by using the cancel button, close button, escape key, and clicking outside the window. Darken the background for a lightbox effect and don't use 50% of the screen for the overlay! Make sure the title is informative to and buttons have acionable names. It is good habit to avoid placing modals in mobile and use elements like the device keyboard and nested scrollbars.</p>

            <p><a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/">Google Calendar</a> is a an example of a modal. It is a user-intiated action. When editing a event, it uses a light box effect, clear buttons and user actions. I would improve it by making the buttons bigger.</p>

            <p>Salim Ansari's article, "<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>" identifies necessary and unnecessary features to create optimal forms that limits friction and increases conversions. By implementing these practices, product designers can improve the ROI in our client's business. </p>

            <p>Less is more! According to Baymard's user research, 21% of users abandon checkout because it is prolonged and/or complicated to finish the checkout process. A one column layout with a progress bar helps users visualize the number of steps before finishing and keeps them in the checkout process. For any follow up questions, save them at the end starting with the easiest! Make sure there is a clear distinction between optional and required information (especially if there are input requirements). It is good habit to avoid placing any text inside the form. Keep the inline labels above and the placeholder text below.</p>

            <p><a href="https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?dsh=S318893566%3A1675201389371519&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F&rip=1&sacu=1&service=mail&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin&ifkv=AWnogHdc_zIHjwkZLzVzY4GWnfiblelXk6O8UN4MfhYbqkDe5rlMsZHfTngfmT2SxCJR-Q2f2rjjpw">Gmail</a> is a an example of a form website. They exhibit an error button with a error message "Couldn't find your Google Account" that has a red indicator under the form. Shop is easy to use because the tasks are simple. I would improve it by changing the "Next" button to "Sign In".</p>
